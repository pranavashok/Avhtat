Critical
- Respond to feedbacks
- Make the left drawer more noticable. Or place some alt links somewhere.
- Reconsider placing initiatives on top bar
- Landing page slideshow - click on image/title takes to article
- Top menu - now the width is set to 4.. make it 5
- Reconsider placement of updates - maybe move it to right
- Formatting of the event pages
- Icons for header menu
- Gallery thumb should show something relevant
- Menus on gallery page (it's using prototype.js :( )
- Sponsors page image placement

To Consider
- Pull the initial slideshow tiles from a couple of options
